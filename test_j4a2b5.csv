This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

with SSL/TLS-enabled services.","The remote host is affected by a man-in-the-middle (MitM) information
disclosure vulnerability known as POODLE. The vulnerability is due to
the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages
encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
MitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few
as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to
repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.

As long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can
be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the
client and service.

The TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks
without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect
connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites
that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.

This is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any
particular SSL implementation. Disabling SSLv3 is the only way to
completely mitigate the vulnerability.","Disable SSLv3.

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when

traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client

allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted,

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

          <p>As you may have guessed by now, this is the default Tomcat home page. It can be found on the local filesystem at:</p>
          <p class=""code"">$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT/index.html</p>
	  
          <p>where ""$CATALINA_HOME"" is the root of the Tomcat installation directory. If you're seeing this page, and you don't think you should be, then you're either a user who has arrived at new installation of Tomcat, or you're an administrator who hasn't got his/her setup quite right. Providing the latter is the case, please refer to the <a href=""/docs"">Tomcat Documentation</a> for more detailed setup and administration information than is found in the INSTALL file.</p>

            <p><b>NOTE: For security reasons, using the manager webapp
            is restricted to users with role ""manager"".</b>

credentials to log into the remote host, however these credentials do

if a given patch has been applied or not.  This is the method Microsoft
recommends to determine if a patch has been applied. 

If your Nessus scanner does not have administrative privileges when
doing a scan, then Nessus has to fall back to perform a patch audit
through the registry which may lead to false positives (especially when
using third-party patch auditing tools) or to false negatives (not all
patches can be detected through the registry).","Reconfigure your scanner to use credentials with administrative

Service) is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack. The RDP 
client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when 
setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept 
traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client 
and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would 
allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, 
including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hard-coded RSA
private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with
access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the
key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if

if a given patch has been applied or not.  This is the method Microsoft
recommends to determine if a patch has been applied.

If RDP has been enabled on the affected system, an unauthenticated,
remote attacker could leverage this vulnerability to cause the system to
execute arbitrary code by sending a sequence of specially crafted RDP
packets to it. 

This plugin also checks for a denial of service vulnerability in
Microsoft Terminal Server. 

Note that this script does not detect the vulnerability if the 'Allow
connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network
Level Authentication' setting is enabled or the security layer is set to
'SSL (TLS 1.0)' on the remote host.","Microsoft has released a set of patches for Windows XP, 2003, Vista,

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","Port 135 was detected as being open but is now unresponsive

    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

- Disable any IPS during the Nessus scan","","Port 8019 was detected as being open but is now unresponsive

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle

clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

weaknesses.","The remote service accepts connections encrypted using SSL 2.0 and/or
SSL 3.0. These versions of SSL are affected by several cryptographic
flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

flaws, including:

  - An insecure padding scheme with CBC ciphers.

  - Insecure session renegotiation and resumption schemes.

An attacker can exploit these flaws to conduct man-in-the-middle
attacks or to decrypt communications between the affected service and
clients.

Although SSL/TLS has a secure means for choosing the highest supported
version of the protocol (so that these versions will be used only if
the client or server support nothing better), many web browsers
implement this in an unsafe way that allows an attacker to downgrade
a connection (such as in POODLE). Therefore, it is recommended that
these protocols be disabled entirely.

NIST has determined that SSL 3.0 is no longer acceptable for secure
communications. As of the date of enforcement found in PCI DSS v3.1,
any version of SSL will not meet the PCI SSC's definition of 'strong
cryptography'.","Consult the application's documentation to disable SSL 2.0 and 3.0.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate

    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the

    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and 
identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out 
man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.","Purchase or generate a proper certificate for this service.","http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509/en

occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be
broken, as stated below :

  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the
    server might not be descended from a known public
    certificate authority. This can occur either when the
    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.

If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the
chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and

    top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
    certificate, or when intermediate certificates are
    missing that would connect the top of the certificate
    chain to a known public certificate authority.

  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate
    that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can
    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the
    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the
    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.

  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature
    that either didn't match the certificate's information
    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by
    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be
    re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be
    verified are the result of the certificate's issuer
    using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not
    support or does not recognize.
